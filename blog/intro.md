## Introduction

This project started after I finished the famous nand2tetris course. I wanted to
run the Pong game that the course authors had provided all on my own. When I
compiled, translated and assembled the Pong Jack files on my own toolchain, it
turned out to be a program that didn't fit the Hack CPU emulator. So, I decided
to make my own emulator and make changes to the specification.
