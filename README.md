Building a modern, general-purpose computer system from the ground up.

My work for the course can be found in the `course/` directory.

After finishing the course, I was interested in extending this platform further.
All the development beyond the course is going on in the `extended` directory in
Python. You can run the "Hello, world!" program by running `./build.sh` in the
`extended` directory. You will need `pygame` for the CPU emulator.
